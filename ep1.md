(When Neel was 14)
Neel: Samira, do you know you are the only one listens what I say. I mean you are only one who values me as human. For you I didn't committed suicide. I kind of like you by the moment. Why you value me? Ain't I a disappointment or a curse from god?
<br>
Samira: Shut up! You ain't a curse you are just a depressed human. And every human being should be valued. And what? suicide? Oh lord! I really pray for you.

Samira: What ....[unfinished]
<br>
[Neel stabs the fishing rod into Samira's eyes multiple time]
<br>
Samira: What had ...[unfinished she started to faint]
<br>
Stabbing in eyes hardly made her eyes non functioning and made her prefrontal cortex non-functioning. If she somehow survive she will not have any logic
<br>
[Neel stabs more time and she died]
<br>
[Neel cries and sees at sky and wonders what had he done and why he done he have no idea]
