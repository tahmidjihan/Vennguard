## Episode One

It's been a while; there are no fish on the rod.
<br>
Samira: This is your bad luck, dude. You aren't going to get any fish today.
<br>
Neel: Huh? At least one tilapia?
<br>
Samira: Not even that, I bet you.
<br>
[Something caught in the rod]
<br>
Neel: See, it might be a big fish.
<br>
Samira: Nah, another tree branch. Mark my words.
<br>
[something moves in water]
<br>
Neel: Hell yeah, that is real fish.
<br>
Samira: Huh?
<br>
[A big tilapia tries to jump out of the water that was caught on the hook.]
<br>
Neel: As I said.
<br>
The tilapia jumps into the lap of Neel. Neel started to feel nauseous; suddenly he felt that his eyesight was getting dimmer and dimmer. He slowly felt like fainting.

### Flashback

(when Neel was 6)
[Obi, the father of Neel]
<br>
Obi: Why are you cursing, cousin? Do you even know what these curse words
Is it even mean?
<br>
(Beats him in his legs with a cloth hanger)
<br>
Neel: I will not do that again.
<br>
Obi: You have to be more behaved, or else you are not going to fit in society. You have to damn well understand that.
<br>
He is in his mind. Do you even know what she said to me? She is a scumbag.
Obi: You are getting ill-mannered day by day. I should beat you more, little boy.
<br>
[Neel in his mind: Do whatever you want without knowing the full story. Does anyone really care about what I feel? Nah, they are all the same—emotionless robots.

### Present

Samira: What happened, Neel? Why do you seem like you are not right?
<br>
Neel: I feel ... weird, strange.

### Flashback

(When Neel was 8)
<br>
[Neel's mother Rekha]
<br>
Rekha: This boy cannot even write the alphabet at 8! I don't know why God is punishing me with a child like that! If he is always like that, he will not pass kindergarten, let alone primary school!
<br>
[Neel in his mind crying because he cannot make her smile but becomes disappointed.]
<br>
(For an 8-year-old, it was too much to carry.)

### Present

Samira: Neel, hell! Are you making a joke like the previous time?
<br>
Samira: Oh shit! Neel! What happened?
<br>
[Samira started to panic because Neel seems like he is fainted.

### Flashback

(When Neel was 11)
<br>
[Neel is sitting on a bench near the lake.]
<br>
Neel (to himself): I am a disappointment for my family. I never bring peace to my family but all the bad. Maybe I came as a curse of God in this home.
I kind of hate myself too much. The only reason I didn't commit suicide is because Samira is there.

### Present

Samira: Neel, Neel!.
<br>
[already fainted Neel and something like a white mucus coming out of his mouth like he was poisoned]

### Flashback

(When Neel was 14)
Neel: Samira, do you know you are the only one who listens to what I say? I mean, you are the only one who values me as a human. For you, I didn't commit suicide. I kind of like you by the moment. Why do you value me? Aren't I a disappointment or a curse from God?
<br>
Samira: Shut up! You aren't a curse; you are just a depressed guy. And every human being should be valued. And what? Suicide? Oh lord! I really pray for you.

### Present

[Neel suddenly wakes up, and his eyes become red.]
<br>
Neel: OOOOOOOH, I can feel something in my mind, like an energy controlling my emotion. OOH.
<br>
Samira: What ... [unfinished]
<br>
[Neel stabs the fishing rod into Samira's eyes multiple times.]
(blood is squirting from her eyes to his shirt—being bloodstained)
<br>
Samira: What had ... [Unfinished, she started to faint.]
<br>
Stabbing in the eyes hardly made her eyes nonfunctional and made her prefrontal cortex nonfunctional. If she somehow survives, she will not have any logic.
<br>
[Neel stabbed more time, and she died, leaving Neel with a red hand of his most loved one.]
<br>
[Neel cries and looks at the sky and wonders what he had done and why he had done it; he has no idea.]
<br>
Neel started to feel intense pain in his body, like a powerful radiation coming from somewhere and affecting his thoughts and body directly.
<br>
[Suddenly he starts to walk toward his home.]
<br>
[Neel's dad, Obi, opens the door.]
He instantly takes his fishing rod and stabs it into his eyes like he did to Samira.
[His mother Rekha comes to see her husband dead.]
Neel instantly kills her in the same way too.
<br>
(blood flows through the corridor to the stairs like an animal is being slaughtered)
<br>
Now he is left with a red hand of his most close ones. He killed his own family, his own loved one.

<br>
Before anyone realized anything, he decided to go somewhere for no reason.
<br>
To this moment, Neel has completely lost his mind, and he has no idea what and why he is doing these things.
<br>
He goes and sits in a passerby bus with no money. When the helper wanted his money, he was kicked out of the bus with much disrespect, but he had already arrived in Cox's Bazar from Chittagong.
