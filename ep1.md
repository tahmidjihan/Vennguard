Its been a while there is no fish in the rod.
<br>
Samira: This is your bad-luck dude. You ain't gonna get any fish today.
<br>
Neel : Huh? At least one tilapia?
<br>
Samira : Not even that I bet you.
<br>
[Something caught in the rod]
<br>
Neel : See it might be a big fish
<br>
Samira : Nah another tree branch. Mark my words.
<br>
[something moves in water]
<br>
Neel : Hell yeah that is real fish.
<br>
Samira : Huh?
<br>
[A big tilapia tries to jump out of the water what was caught on the hook]
<br>
Neel: As I said.
<br>
The tilapia jumps into the lap of Neel. Neel started to feel nausea suddenly he felt that his eyesight is being dimmer and dimmer. He slowly felt like fainting.

### Flashback

A little 6 years old just beaten by his father for cussing his elder sister. He gets these sessions a lot because he has so many flaws in eyes of society.
None sees that he also have and feels pain. And it can mess his life for a 6 years old. Just flaws and that leads him to some thing he don't like.
No one really knows and not even realize how much this 6 years old kid carries in his heart.

### Present

Samira: What happened, Neel why are you seem like you are not right
<br>
Neel : I feel a bit weird right now.

### Flashback

One day he had homeworks from his school. He cannot do it. He cannot find purpose of his studies so he never does it. Everyone says him to follow orders but he don't. He questions and he feels like everyone hates him for his questions.
To some extend it is true. His mother cussed him a lot for not doing the homework properly.
<br>
He grew bearing these pains with him none to share.He constantly failed in exams - just cause of not finding purpose to pass and no one makes him clear.

### Present

Samira: Neel, Neel Wake up. Hell are you making a joke like previous time?
<br>
Samira: Oh Shit! Neel! Neel!
<br>
[Samira started to panic cause neel seems like he is fainted]

### Flashback

Being beat up every time he does something exceptional he never tried socializing. He thought that is wrong also. So he couldn't share anything to anyone.
<br>
He feels like he is hated by everyone maybe he is.
At a moment he was primmed that maybe he is a bad person. He is the one who does wrong stuff. He usually wonders why god made him this way. No one to share this stuff. He carries a lot.
<br>
By 11 he started to believe that he is curse of god to his family. He is nothing but burden. He started to hate himself for that. He really started to think that everything bad in family is cause of him. He is bad person a low-intelligence guy being curse for the world and family.

By 13 he tried to commit suicide but he met a friend- Samira. In the world where everyone hates him someone seems to at least listened to him what he said. Someone responded to what he Said. The only one had empathy for him.

### Present

Samira: Neel, Neel Wake up.
<br>
[already fainted neil and something like a white mucus coming out of his mouth like he was poisoned]

### Flashback

Neel started to like Samira by 14 cause of her charming and being only one who at least nods when he speaks.
<br>
Neel had a hobby developed from 13 it is fishing. he started to fish every saturday. He goes in the Foy's lake with Samira and spends time with fishing rod and her. They argue a lot about if this time is when what fish can be caught.
<br>

### Present

[Neel suddenly wakes up and his eyes become red]
<br>
Neel: OOOOOOOH I can feel something in my mind like an energy controlling my emotion. OOH.
<br>
Samira: What ....[unfinished]
<br>
[Neel stabs the fishing rod into Samira's eyes multiple time]
<br>
Samira: What had ...[unfinished she started to faint]
<br>
Stabbing in eyes hardly made her eyes non functioning and made her prefrontal cortex non-functioning. If she somehow survive she will not have any logic
<br>
[Neel stabs more time and she died]
<br>
[Neel cries and sees at sky and wonders what had he done and why he done he have no idea]
<br>
Neel started to feel intense pain in his body like a powerful radiation coming from somewhere and effecting on his thoughts and body directly.
<br>
[Suddenly he starts to walk toward his home]
<br>
[Neel's dad Obi opens the door]
He instantly takes his fishing rod and stabs it into his eyes like he did to Samira.
[His mother Rekha comes to see her husband dead]
Neel instantly kills her in same way too.

<br>
Before anyone realize anything he decided to go somewhere for no reason.
<br>
To this moment Neel completely lost his mind and he has no idea what and why he is doing these stuff.
<br>
He goes and sits in a passerby bus with no money. When the helper wanted his money he was kicked out of the bus with much disrespect but he already arrived Cox's Bazar from Chittagong.
